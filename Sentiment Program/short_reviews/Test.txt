Can a criminal be sentenced to run a ¡§help desk¡¨?

Sheldon Silver, the former powerful speaker of the New York State Assembly who was convicted of public corruption charges in May, hopes so.

Mr. Silver, 74, is to be sentenced on July 27 in Manhattan, and federal prosecutors asked the judge on Friday to impose a sentence ¡§substantially in excess¡¨ of 10 years.

But Mr. Silver¡¦s lawyers had a more creative proposal for how he could pay his debt to society.

After a ¡§meaningful custodial sentence,¡¨ they suggested, he should be ordered to perform ¡§rigorous¡¨ community service, like running a special help desk.

In that role, they said, he would be helping New Yorkers ¡§navigate their way through the state bureaucracy to answer their questions, and maximize their chances of receiving benefits to which they may be entitled.¡¨

Dean G. Skelos, once one of the most powerful figures in New York State politics, was found guilty of bribery, extortion and conspiracy on Tuesday, the latest in a drumbeat of corruption convictions to roil Albany in a heated election year.

The verdict itself was not necessarily a surprise, as a different jury had found Mr. Skelos, the former leader of the State Senate, and his son guilty on the same charges in 2015 before the convictions were overturned. But its timing ¡X on the heels of three other successful Albany-focused prosecutions this year, including one last week in the courtroom next door ¡X fed the perception that the culture of ethical neglect in the state capital had reached its nadir.

Within an hour of the conviction, political candidates and government watchdog groups were already lobbing criticism of Albany¡¦s seemingly intractable webs of money and power ¡X and of the power brokers, including Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who they said had not done enough to untangle them.

The jury in Federal District Court in Manhattan deliberated for three days before finding Mr. Skelos and his son, Adam, guilty on all eight counts. Prosecutors said the older Mr. Skelos, the former leader of the Senate¡¦s Republican majority, had wielded his political clout to pressure business executives to send his son about $300,000 for a patchwork of no-show or low-show jobs.

A Singaporean woman was sentenced to 33 months in jail on Friday for her role in a massive bribery scandal dubbed the "Fat Leonard" case that rocked the US Navy.

Gursharan Kaur Sharon Rachael, 57, a former lead contract specialist with the US Navy, was charged at a district court in the city-state in late 2015 for leaking confidential information in exchange for cash and luxury vacations.

She had been giving the information to Malaysian businessman Leonard Francis, who ran a port services firm called Glenn Defense Marine Asia (GDMA).

The portly, Singapore-based Francis - dubbed "Fat Leonard" - had admitted to plying officers with cash, booze, prostitutes and other perks to ensure US Navy ships stopped at ports where his firm operated.
